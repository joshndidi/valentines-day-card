                                            My darling, this past month of
                                            dating and two months of
                                            knowing you have been nothing
                                            short of extraordinary. Time
                                            has flown by so quickly, and
                                            it's hard to believe it's
                                            already been a whole month
                                            since we became official and
                                            two months since you first
                                            walked into my life. They say
                                            time moves fast when you're
                                            with the ones you love, but
                                            with you, it feels like every
                                            moment is suspended in this
                                            beautiful space where nothing
                                            else matters except us. You've
                                            made my days so much brighter,
                                            Liv, like the sun breaking
                                            through clouds after a storm.
                                            My life feels so much easier
                                            now because I know I have you
                                            by my side, someone who
                                            genuinely understands me and
                                            supports me in ways I never
                                            thought possible. And whenever
                                            we're apart, I find myself
                                            missing you so deeply,
                                            counting down the seconds
                                            until I can see you again,
                                            hear your voice, feel your
                                            presence. You've become such
                                            an essential part of my life
                                            that being without you feels
                                            incomplete.

                                            Liv, you are, without a
                                            single doubt, the prettiest
                                            girl to ever exist. I
                                            don't think I'll ever stop
                                            being in awe and admiration
                                            of you. Your beauty is the
                                            kind that takes my breath
                                            away every single time I look
                                            at you, the kind that makes me
                                            wonder how I got so incredibly
                                            lucky. I don't even know how
                                            to put it into words because
                                            it goes beyond anything I've
                                            ever experienced before. In my
                                            eyes, you are the most
                                            stunning person to walk this
                                            earth, and I mean that with
                                            every fibre of my being. And
                                            those green eyes of yours, my
                                            love, they're absolutely
                                            mesmerising. They're like
                                            emeralds catching the light,
                                            holding entire worlds within
                                            them. When I look into your
                                            green eyes, I feel like I'm
                                            being pulled into something
                                            deeper, something magical.
                                            They sparkle with life and
                                            emotion, and every time they
                                            meet mine, it feels like
                                            everything else fades away,
                                            leaving just us in our own
                                            little universe. I could get
                                            lost in those beautiful green
                                            eyes forever, discovering new
                                            depths and stories with every
                                            glance. The way they light up
                                            when you smile, the way they
                                            express everything you're
                                            feeling, they're simply
                                            extraordinary.

                                            And my baby, your scent is
                                            something so divine that I
                                            feel like I could just breathe
                                            it in forever. There's
                                            something about the way you
                                            smell that makes me feel so
                                            incredibly good, like
                                            everything is right in the
                                            world when I'm close enough to
                                            catch it. I genuinely wish I
                                            had a piece of your clothing
                                            that carried your scent, just
                                            so I could have that comfort
                                            with me when we're apart.
                                            Whenever I'm around you, I
                                            find myself wishing I could
                                            smell you all the time because
                                            it simply makes me feel so
                                            amazing, so content, so at
                                            peace. Your scent is uniquely
                                            yours, Liv, and it's one of
                                            those things that I've come to
                                            associate with happiness and
                                            home.

                                            your facial features are
                                            absolutely incredible. Every

                                            that so much. I know there
                                            might be things about your

                                            or that you might be insecure
                                            about, but let me tell you
                                            this, it will never stop me
                                            from loving them. Every single
                                            aspect of your face, from your
                                            nose to your lips to the way
                                            your expressions shift, it's
                                            all so uniquely beautiful to
                                            me. I notice all the little
                                            details about you, my love,
                                            and I cherish every single one
                                            of them. Your features come
                                            together in this way that's
                                            entirely you, and that's what
                                            makes you so breathtaking.
                                            Even if you dislike certain
                                            things about yourself, I hope
                                            you know that I find every
                                            part of you stunning. You are
                                            extraordinary, Liv, and your
                                            face is just one of the many
                                            things that makes you so
                                            incredibly special to me.

                                            And Liv, our sweet messages
                                            and flirting mean the absolute
                                            world to me. I love how we can
                                            go from being the freakiest
                                            people ever to having the most
                                            deep, meaningful conversations
                                            in the blink of an eye. I love
                                            that we can be there for each
                                            other where it always matters
                                            most, that we connect on so
                                            many different levels. The way
                                            we flirt with each other makes
                                            my heart race, and I love how
                                            naturally it flows between us.
                                            Your words always feel so nice,
                                            so warm, so full of affection,
                                            and they never fail to make me
                                            smile like an idiot. Every
                                            time you text me or talk to
                                            me, I get this rush of
                                            happiness that fills my entire
                                            being. I love how we just
                                            click, how we understand each
                                            other's humour and can make
                                            each other laugh whilst also
                                            being able to have those
                                            serious, heartfelt moments
                                            that bring us even closer. The
                                            connection we share is
                                            something so special, my
                                            cutie, and I treasure every
                                            single conversation we have,
                                            whether it's playful banter or
                                            something more intimate and
                                            vulnerable.

                                            And darling, your body is
                                            something I absolutely adore.
                                            Your proportions are so
                                            excellent, and I love every
                                            single part of you. No matter
                                            what you might think about
                                            your body, I want you to know
                                            that I love every single cell
                                            that makes you up. Every curve,
                                            every line, every part of you
                                            is incredible to me, and I
                                            wouldn't change a thing. I
                                            have no lust for you, only
                                            pure, genuine love, but this
                                            is definitely something I love
                                            a lot about you. Your body is
                                            beautiful, and it's a part of
                                            who you are, which makes it
                                            even more precious to me. I
                                            hope you can see yourself the
                                            way I see you, because to me,
                                            you are absolutely stunning
                                            from head to toe. You are
                                            breathtaking, Liv, and I'll
                                            never stop reminding you of
                                            that. Everything about you,
                                            inside and out, is something I
                                            cherish deeply.

                                            just physical. Your
                                            personality is what truly
                                            captures my heart. You are so
                                            kind and caring, and I love
                                            being held and cuddled by you
                                            more than I can express. No
                                            matter what mood I'm in,
                                            whether I'm stressed, sad, or
                                            frustrated, you always manage
                                            to fix it, sometimes without
                                            even knowing you're doing it.
                                            You have this incredible
                                            ability to make everything
                                            better just by being yourself,
                                            by being there for me. Your
                                            presence is so comforting, so
                                            warm, and it makes me feel
                                            safe and loved. And then
                                            there's your sense of humour,
                                            Liv, which I absolutely love
                                            SOOOO much. You are genuinely
                                            one of the funniest people
                                            I've ever met. Your laugh
                                            makes me laugh simply because
                                            I know that whatever you're
                                            laughing about is bound to be
                                            incredibly funny. Your humour
                                            is so uniquely you, and it
                                            brings so much joy and light
                                            into my life. I love how we
                                            can make each other laugh
                                            until our stomachs hurt, how
                                            we can find humour in the
                                            smallest things. You make
                                            every day brighter with your
                                            personality, and I'm so
                                            grateful for that.

                                            you. You are everything I've

                                            much more. Most times without

                                            all my needs so amazingly, and

                                            before in my entire life. What
                                            we have is so special, and I
                                            know without a doubt that
                                            you're the one for me. You
                                            make me feel complete in ways
                                            I didn't even know were
                                            possible, and I'm endlessly

                                            share this journey with. You
                                            are my dream come true, Liv,
                                            and I'll never take that for
                                            granted.

                                            admire your strength, your
                                            determination, and your
                                            resilience so much. No matter
                                            what challenges come your way,
                                            you face them with courage,
                                            and that's something I'll
                                            always be in awe of. I want
                                            you to know that I see you, I
                                            see your progress, and I'm so
                                            incredibly proud of the person
                                            you are and the person you're
                                            becoming.

                                            My cutie, I love and adore you
                                            so much that you cannot even
                                            begin to comprehend it. My
                                            love for you is beyond
                                            measure, beyond words, beyond
                                            anything I've ever felt
                                            before. No matter what
                                            happens, no matter what you're
                                            feeling, whether you're angry,
                                            sad, happy, or even horny, I'm
                                            always going to be there to
                                            love you and attend to your
                                            needs. I'll be there through
                                            thick and thin, through every
                                            high and every low, because
                                            that's what love is. You are
                                            my everything, Liv, and I
                                            promise to cherish you, to
                                            support you, and to stand by
                                            your side no matter what life
                                            throws our way. Thank you for
                                            being the best girlfriend I've
                                            ever had and will ever have.
                                            Thank you for making me feel
                                            so comfortable, something I've
                                            never experienced with anyone
                                            before. I'm so glad that
                                            we're not just partners but
                                            also best friends, because
                                            that makes what we have even
                                            more special. You are my
                                            person, my soulmate, my
                                            forever, and I love you more
                                            than the entire universe
                                            could ever hold. From ur
